# Register now for PNSQC Free Workshop Day!

[](https://www.pnsqc.org/register) On January 23, PNSQC is hosting a **full day of hands-on, instructor-led workshops** focused on practical quality skills — from foundational testing practices to emerging AI-driven approaches.  This is not a marketing event.

It is a **community learning day** , led by experienced practitioners, designed to give you techniques, frameworks, and perspectives you can apply immediately.  
As a nonprofit conference, PNSQC’s mission is _Enabling Quality Through Community_ .  
This workshop day is part of that mission — lowering barriers to learning, strengthening our local quality community, and helping practitioners stay relevant as the industry evolves. [Register](https://mms.pnsqc.org/members/evr/reg_event.php?evid=59880123&orgcode=PNSQ) [now](https://mms.pnsqc.org/members/evr/reg_event.php?evid=59880123&orgcode=PNSQ) or read the [blog post for a full description](https://www.pnsqc.org/blog/blog/2026-01-03-start-2026-with-a-free-day-of-handson-qa-workshops) of the workshops.

**Afternoon Workshops (1:00 PM – 4:30 PM)**

* Integrate MCP into your workflow with Joe Petsche  - We will work with a variety of MCP servers to connect your quality apps and find ways to do your job better and faster. Come with your apps and we will connect in to your scenarios too.

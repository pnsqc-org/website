# Image Generation Prompting Guide

## Principles

- Describe the scene (subject, environment, lighting, mood), not just keywords.
- Use positive framing when possible (state what you want, not only what you don’t).
- Add composition details (camera angle, lens, framing) when you care about the look.

## Best practices

| Tip | Example |
|-----|---------|
| Be specific | “Ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns” instead of “fantasy armor” |
| Prefer positive constraints | “Deserted street with no traffic” instead of “no cars” |
| Specify camera/framing | “Wide-angle shot”, “macro shot”, “elevated 45-degree shot”, “Dutch angle” |
| Specify lighting | “Golden hour light”, “three-point softbox setup”, “dramatic side lighting” |
| Mention lens/camera | “85mm portrait lens”, “fisheye lens”, “DSLR quality” |

## Prompting by use case

- **Photorealistic**: Write like a photographer: subject, action, environment, lighting, mood, camera specs.
- **Illustrations / stickers**: Name the style (e.g., “kawaii-style”), line style, background (e.g., “white background”).
- **Text in images**: Provide exact text, font style, colors, layout, and design aesthetic.
- **Product mockups**: Use studio photography language; emphasize sharp focus on key details.
- **Minimalist backgrounds**: Ask for negative space where you’ll place copy; keep the focal subject off-center if needed.

## Iteration tips

- If character features drift between iterations, restart with a more detailed description.
- Include the image’s purpose (hero background, icon, poster) so composition matches the use.

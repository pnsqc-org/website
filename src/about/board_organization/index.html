          PNSQC is managed by a seven-member board elected by the voting members at the annual meeting in November. Board members serve a three-year term. The terms are staggered so that only 2-3 board members are elected in any given year. The board elects officers at a meeting subsequent to the annual meeting. The board and other active volunteers conduct their business at monthly business meetings that generally occur on the second Wednesday of the month.

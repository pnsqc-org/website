<h2 id="instructions-for-authors">Instructions for Authors</h2>
<p>PNSQC values practical information that can be applied directly to
software engineering practices. Our conference attendees expect to get
information from your technical paper and your presentation that they
can bring back and use at their workplace following the conference. The
primary Author of any paper receives free admission to the two-day
technical conference. If the Author chooses to present in person at the
conference all travel and lodging are the responsibility of the
Author.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-submit-my-proposal">How Do I Submit My Proposal?</h3>
<p>Authors first <a
href="https://mms.pnsqc.org/members/proposals/propselect.php?orgcode=PNSQ&amp;prid=1385427">submit
a proposal abstract</a> through the PNSQC website. Your abstract will be
reviewed by a selection committee and if you have a great story to tell,
you will be invited to write your paper and attend to present your
paper. Please note that if your paper is accepted, you are expected to
present your paper physically at the conference. We cannot accept
virtual remote presentations as it reduces the quality of the experience
of the conference participants.</p>
<p>Note that the program includes Keynote and Invited Speakers, Full
Technical Papers, and <a href="https://pnsqc.org/poster">Poster
Papers.</a></p>
<h3 id="how-are-proposals-selected">How Are Proposals Selected?</h3>
<p>All proposals are reviewed by the Program Selection Committee. The
program selection committee looks at the whole picture when reviewing
your proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>How impactful will your paper be to the attendees?</li>
<li>What is the relevance of the problem you solved?</li>
<li>What is the reach of your technical contribution to the
community?</li>
<li>Is your contribution applicable to other domains or
organizations?</li>
</ul>
<p>We also take into account the topic of your paper and its
relationship to past conferences. The program selection committee also
prepares for the inevitable by selecting backup technical papers, in
case there is a cancellation.</p>
<h3 id="acceptance-and-review">Acceptance And Review</h3>
<p>The Program Committee Chair will then assign one or more reviewers to
work with you on your technical paper. Reviewers assigned to you will
make contact via email. Technical papers must meet all conference
deadlines to be made available to attendees before the event.</p>
<p>Please note that if you decide to write a technical paper you will be
the author. Our reviewers will work with you to ensure that your content
is clear and that it meets the PNSQC standards. They are your resource
to assist you in writing a professional paper and have been given
specific <a
href="https://www.pnsqc.org/docs/PNSQC_Reviewer_Guidance_V2.0_2.pdf">Reviewer
Guidelines</a> on how to give you feedback and work with you towards
this objective. However, they will not rewrite sentences, restructure
content, or edit for grammar and vocabulary. If you are unsure about
your abilities to deliver a technical paper that meets PNSQC standards,
please arrange for reviewers, editors, or co-authors at your company to
help you. If English is your second language, congratulations on
stepping up to the challenge! You may want to have a native English
speaker review your paper to help you with grammar, punctuation, and
spelling. English isn‘t easy! Keep in mind that while you may use
Generative AI to provide minimal assistance, it must be fully disclosed
as per our <a
href="/about/governance/generative-ai-policy/">Generative
AI Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Submit your revisions to an <a
href="https://mms.pnsqc.org/members/proposals/propselect.php?orgcode=PNSQ&amp;prid=1385427">existing
proposal</a> by logging with your UserID and password.</p>
<p>Papers that are approved by reviewers will be uploaded to the PNSQC
website. The program committee has the final authority to reject a paper
if it decides that the paper does not meet the PNSQC quality
standards.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-submit-my-paper">How Do I Submit My Paper?</h3>
<p>You may access your <a href="/cfp/">existing
proposal</a> through the PNSQC website. Once your abstract is accepted,
you‘ll work with two reviewers toward a final camera-ready paper. You
must submit your paper, presentation, or poster in the right format
using the templates below. This is critical for our conference
proceedings to look professional as all content will be consistent. Some
important notes are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You are encouraged to use color in your drawings if you think it
would add value to the visual aspect of the graphics.</li>
<li>You must not change the margins on the left, right, top, and bottom
of the template as this will affect our formatting for the
proceedings.</li>
<li>The maximum number of pages for your paper is 12 pages. We cannot
accept anything over this page limit.</li>

<h3 id="do-i-have-to-be-present-at-the-conference">Do I Have To Be
Present At The Conference?</h3>
<p><strong>Yes.</strong> To present your paper at the conference you
must agree to attend the event. Although we waive your conference fees,
presenters are responsible for presenting their papers either in-person
at the conference. While we do have some limited presentation slots for
virtual presentations, we strongly encourage live in-person
participation to maximize the experience for both authors and conference
attendees. If you have a co-author, they can receive admission to the
conference at 1/2 price, so encourage your co-authors to attend as
well.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-i-am-a-first-time-presenter">What If I Am A First-Time
Presenter?</h3>
<p>Great! PNSQC strongly encourages first-time presenters. Giving a talk
can be scary if you are new to it, so we recommend that you practice in
front of friends before the big day. If you have a good idea but are
unsure how to begin, please reach out to us and we will help you get
started! There are some great references above that will also help.</p>
<h3 id="winning-a-presentation-award">Winning A Presentation Award</h3>
<p>The Program Committee values the professional presentation of content
contributing to the body of knowledge for software quality. In the last
3 years, we have brought back the concept of best presentation awards
and have taken pride in ’growing our own‘ and invited the top three to
return the following year as invited speakers. We hope that these
speakers (usually new speakers, aka nerds who have written a paper) will
join the field of QA professionals who feel comfortable standing up and
sharing their knowledge and expertise.</p>
<p>We award the top presentation in each track (Emerging Technologies
and Concepts, Technology, Management Leadership and People, and Process
and Tools), in addition to special awards for Most Creative, and Most
Interactive and Engaging; for a total of five awards. With this award
structure, we hope to not only continue our tradition of ’home-grown‘ by
inviting these speakers back the following year but also encourage depth
in each track as well as presentation characteristics that improve the
overall quality and value of the conference for everyone. As usual,
winners will be voted upon by the community at the conference (bring
your friends and colleagues to vote for your presentation).</p>

<h2 id="guide-about-copyright">Guide About Copyright</h2>
<p>Copyright law allows presenters fair use of previous works. As long
as the presenter follows normal writing style guidelines, there
shouldn’t be an issue. PNSQC suggests the <em>Chicago Manual of
Style</em>, see the <a
href="https://pnsqc.org/docs/PNSQC-Paper-and-Brief-Template-2020.docx">PNSQC
Paper and Brief Template</a> or <a
href="https://pnsqc.org/docs/PNSQC2021-PPT-Template-V1.pptx">PNSQC
Template (pptx)</a> for additional details). More care needs to be taken
with songs, poems, and other artistic works. The presenter should take
care when using these in either the paper or the presentation,
especially if using the ‘whole’ item (e.g. a complete poem). The
presenter should check with the source to make sure that appropriate
permissions are obtained prior to publishing the paper/presentation.</p>
<p>PNSQC is not a platform for any political ideology and the author
should refrain from expressing political views.</p>
<p>Presenter’s, by confirming that they will develop and present a
paper, also confirm acceptance of the <a
href="https://pnsqc.org/docs/PNSQC-Author-Copyright-Agreement.pdf">PNSQC
Author Copyright Agreement</a> that indemnifies PNSQC from claims
arising from copyright issues and gives PNSQC the right to publish your
work, while also ensuring that the author retains the right of ownership
for their work.</p>
<p>We suggest <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law%C2%A0#Fair_use_and_fair_deal">Wikipedia's
Copyright</a> as a starting point for presenters looking for more
information on fair use and copyright issues.</p>

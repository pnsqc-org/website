            Signal Before the Storm: How Quality Intelligence Can Stop Harm Before it Becomes Irreversible
          </h4>
          <div class="space-y-4 text-pnsqc-slate leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              When my 86-year-old Aunt Cathy was scammed online and lost tens of thousands of dollars, every signal needed to prevent it was already there: the password reset that completed faster than she ever could have managed it, the navigation that moved with a confidence she'd never shown, the cash advance request that appeared out of nowhere. The failure wasn't the fraudster's ingenuity; it was the system's inability to recognize that the wrong person was in the room.
            </p>
            <p>
              This session discusses Quality Intelligence (QI) as a framework for connecting behavioral, biometric, and transactional signals before they converge into irreversible harm, creating a strategic framework for prevention. Attendees will learn why empathy is not a soft skill; it's the analytical foundation of prevention.

              Kristine O'Connor spent several years in the United States Navy before entering the software industry in 1998. Starting her journey at the help desk for a hotel software company, she quickly moved into software testing, finding a home for her process-driven thought process, customer-centric mindset, and knack for tools. For over 18 years, Kristine has filled various software quality roles, from manual software testing to a Sr. QA Project Manager and Agile and DevOps practitioner in a Fortune 4 organization. In 2018, she dipped her toes in the coaching water and transitioned into the role of certified Agile Coach (ICC-ACP), ultimately achieving her Scaled Agile Practice Consultant (SPC). Kristine has supported organizations such as Aetna, CVS Health, Bank of America, Northrop Grumman, NASA, and more.

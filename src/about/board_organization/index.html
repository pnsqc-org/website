          PNSQC is managed by a seven-member board elected by the voting members at the annual meeting in November. Board members serve a three-year term. The terms are staggered so that only 2-3 board members are elected in any given year. The board elects officers at a meeting subsequent to the annual meeting. The board and other active volunteers conduct their business at monthly business meetings that generally occur on the second Wednesday of the month. See the events calendar for specifics. The current board members are:

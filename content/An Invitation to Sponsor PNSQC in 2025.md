# An Invitation to Sponsor PNSQC in 2025

Lead the movement for software quality, as we celebrate the 42nd annual conference this fall. Our 2025 program will explore the theme of the QI: Increase Your Quality Intelligence. Join us as leaders of the software quality engineering profession gather, in person and virtually, to discuss the latest trends in software development, QA and testing.

PNSQC is now in its fourth decade of hosting its prestigious annual software quality conference. As the longest running conference in North America focused on software quality, we take pride in attendees leaving the conference with real solutions they can use.

Sponsorships are per calendar year. There are two aspects of sponsorships:

1.  **Opportunities for industry players to give back to the software quality field and related professions.**
    PNSQC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, Oregon-based nonprofit with a mission of spreading knowledge and ideas about software quality, strengthening the software field, and helping members of the PNSQC community in advancing their professional objectives.

2.  **Opportunities for sponsors to promote themselves.**
    In addition to hosting monthly seminars, panel discussions and meetups, PNSQC plans to add other professional development community activities. Please inquire about sponsoring any of these events. We urge prospective sponsors to become a special member of the PNSQC community -- both in promoting thought leadership and in making a difference to our profession.

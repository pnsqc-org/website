        <div class="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-white">
          <p>The Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference (PNSQC) was founded in 1982 as a non-profit, 501(c)3 Oregon corporation and is governed by its <a class="text-pnsqc-gold hover:text-pnsqc-gold-light transition-colors" href="http://www.pnsqc.org/docs/PNSQC_Articles_501_papers.pdf">Articles of Incorporation</a> and <a class="text-pnsqc-gold hover:text-pnsqc-gold-light transition-colors" href="http://www.pnsqc.org/docs/Bylaws_of_PNSQC_V1.2.3.pdf">Bylaws</a>.</p>
          <p>PNSC is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to bringing Quality Best Practices to anyone and everyone interested in learning. We do this through our annual conference and other satellite events that bring people together to discuss Quality topics.</p>
          <p>We believe that PNSQC should be A Bastion of Meritocracy (Possibly even the Last Bastion of Meritocracy). You don't have to know anyone special, be famous, or be part of an In Crowd to speak at PNSQC. We evaluate conference submissions solely on the merit of the ideas. If you've got a good idea and experience to share that would bring value to our community, you can present it at PNSQC. It's that simple.</p>
          <p>By creating a conference from your great ideas, we can build a community dedicated to All Things Quality including People, Software, Hardware, Systems, and Organizations. Wherever there is a need for Quality, we want to be there, and we want you to be there with us.</p>
          <p>Building a great community needs a myriad of viewpoints. Thus, diversity and inclusion are vital, and we have assembled the following statement to spell out our philosophy.</p>
          <p>Annually, PNSQC provides a one-day workshop and a two-day technical program during our fall conference. PNSQC events draw participants from Universities and Corporations from around the world. Among the major participants are ADP, Boeing Computer Services, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Mentor Graphics, Tektronix, Microsoft, Portland State University and Oregon State University.</p>

          <p>As an organization, we believe in bringing Quality Best Practices to anyone and everyone by creating a safe space for anyone and everyone to participate. PNSQC works to ensure that our board, volunteers, and conference attendees reflect the diverse reality of the world. In everything we do, we strive to ensure a quality experience for everyone, regardless of ability, age, cultural identity, education level, professional background, ethnicity, faith, gender, gender expression, gender identity, ideology, income, national origin, race, or sexual orientation.</p>

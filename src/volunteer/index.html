          PNSQC is directed by volunteers. Most of the work needed to produce events is also performed by volunteers, which is why PNSQC events are so affordable. As a volunteer-based organization, PNSQC is always looking for new volunteers to bring fresh ideas into the organization. PNSQC divides itself into committees to get the work done to produce events.
